Thanks for checking out our game. We are David Lozano and Joan Valiente from CITM.

1-O is a platformer game made for the Game Development 1 subject from UPC-CITM. The main goal of this assignment is
to create a simple platformer with some levels created with Tiled, enemies with a pathfinding algorithm that follows the player, and UI.


For the enemies, player, rewards, etc, we have created system that allows to spawn any kind of entity from Tiled.
For the UI, we have done a similar system, that allows to create buttons, labels, sliders and images with it's basic functionalities.


# 1-0
In 1-O you're a guy from Catalonia and your objective is to arrive to the end of the levels to vote.


Make it as fast as you can, collecting every urn and finishing with all your enemies to make more points!
Thanks for playing and have fun!
